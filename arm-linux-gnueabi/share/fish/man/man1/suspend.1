.SS "Description"
\fCsuspend\fP suspends execution of the current shell by sending it a SIGTSTP signal, returning to the controlling process\&. It can be resumed later by sending it a SIGCONT\&. In order to prevent suspending a shell that doesn't have a controlling process, it will not suspend the shell if it is a login shell\&. This requirement is bypassed if the \fC--force\fP option is given or the shell is not interactive\&.
